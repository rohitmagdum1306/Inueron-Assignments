    "Q4) What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is made up of operators, operands, and sometimes function calls, which are combined together to produce a value. Here's a breakdown of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators: Operators perform specific operations on the operands to produce a result. Examples of operators include mathematical operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==), logical operators (and, or, not), and assignment operators (=).\n",
    "\n",
    "Operands: Operands are the values or variables on which the operators act. They can be literals (specific values like numbers or strings) or variables (placeholders that store values). For example, in the expression 5 + 3, the operands are 5 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calls: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. In some expressions, function calls can be used as operands or as part of the expression itself. Functions may take arguments (values passed to them) and return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are a fundamental part of programming, and they serve various purposes. Here's what expressions typically do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute values: Expressions evaluate and compute a value based on the operators and operands used. For example, the expression 5 + 3 evaluates to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform operations: Expressions combine operators to perform specific operations. This can include mathematical calculations, logical evaluations, string manipulations, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign values: Expressions can be used in assignment statements to assign a computed value to a variable. For example, x = 5 + 3 assigns the value 8 to the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow: Expressions are often used in conditional statements (if, while, for) to determine the flow of execution in a program. The result of an expression can determine whether a block of code is executed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, expressions are composed of operators, operands, and sometimes function calls. They compute values, perform operations, assign values, and control the flow of a program. They are essential for manipulating and transforming data in programming.\n",
